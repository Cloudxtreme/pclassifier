pclassifier
===================================

You need Apache Ant [1] and the Java runtime environment to build and run
the software. To build, execute

  $ ant clean compile jar

from the main directory. This will create two jar files - pclassifier.jar (the
main gateway system) and service.jar (an implementation of the toy service as
described in the paper) - in the build/jar directory.

There is a configuration file at main.Configuration, which can be used to
configure listening hosts and other parameters.

Once the system is running, you are able to connect to the Gateway via any TCP
client (e.g. telnet for testing).
